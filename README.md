# is the cat in?
This is my cat:

I've used a raspberry pi and a reed switch to detect when he uses his cat flap. When he does, he gets his picture taken and uploaded for the world to see on [isthecat.in](http://isthecat.in). The code in this repo is for that site (not for the RPi, though if you're interested in that feel free to ask).

Be warned: I am relatively new to django. I cannot promise that any of this will be even remotely good.

Please report any issues and/or feel free to contribute!
